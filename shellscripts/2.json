Think agile manifesto over agile methodology. It turns out the things I thought were great agile practices, while useful in certain circumstances, are by no means the whole story. Kaizen, or continuous improvement, must be coupled with kaikaku, or abrupt change, in order to avoid getting stuck in the local maximum of 1990s Agile methods. This talk is about how really high-performing teams work. Not just one or two flukes but enough that there might be something to it. The patterns and ideas in this talk are genuine experiences from active practitioners. This is agile in actuality. Agile is an attitude, not a rulebook.\"",

Do you abandon your dreams of making it all better with Scala? Do you go home and play with Clojure in a pet project on your spare time? How do you know if these tools will live up to your expectations in a Real Life Environment?\n In this talk, Trisha will show the real world example of how the MongoDB Java Driver team use Groovy - in a library that, when built, cannot contain additional dependencies, and must run in plain Java runtime environments.\n How? By cheating, and using Gradle for building and Spock for testing, this Java team got to use a new JVM language in anger with the goal of making their lives easier. And it worked.  Mostly.",

For instance, to add a new data variant in OO, you may add a new subclass. Or in functional programming, it's easy to add new operations over a data type. However, the kind of extensibility offered by OO does not work in FP (try adding a constructor), and vice versa (adding an operation over a family of classes).  This deep and inherent trade-off has become known as the \"expression problem\". Object algebras are a new and simple solution to the expression problem which works in mainstream programming languages such as Java, C#, Dart, and Scala. In this session I'll introduce the expression problem in some depth, and show how the object algebra style of programming is a solution to it.",

At the end, you will have a better understanding of the research world as a whole, and have practical pointers for making your own programming more joyful.",

Good programmers are lazy - so why waste your time implementing a solution when the computer can do it for you?\n In this session you will learn how to let the computer solve your problems with declarative programming. It is a programming paradigm that allows the programmer to describe a problem and the requirements on the solutions in an intuitive way, rather than describing the algorithm to find the solutions to the problem.  ASP (Answer Set Programming) is a declarative programming paradigm with its roots in knowledge representation and reasoning, a subset of artificial intelligence. In this session we\u2019ll introduce you to the basic principles of this programming paradigm through guided exercises.  You will get acquainted with concepts like negation as failure, closed world assumption and model generation.\n Join us for some hands-on fun!

We'll also have some hands-on exercises to show the power of mutation testing techniques, as well as the dangers and costs of them.\n There is a well maintained tool for Java (PITest) and a less well maintained tool for .NET (NinjaTurtles). We'll try using both/either, so come with laptops and your favourite IDE (although I will be asking you to work in pairs, sharing a single machine).",
